   - Total credit price including interest
   - Monthly repayment over 24 months
4. Displays a custom message including:
   - Customer's name
   - Message
   - Monthly installment
   - Total credit price

- `EditText` fields: Name, Message, Tablet Choice
- `Button`: Calculate, Quit
- `TextView`: Display result

## Input Validation

## Use Case
